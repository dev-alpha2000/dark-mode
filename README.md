## Overview
This project is a Dark Mode Toggle app built using React. It allows users to switch between light and dark themes, demonstrating how to implement dark mode in a React application. The theme preference is saved to local storage so it persists across page reloads.

## Features

Dark Mode Toggle: Users can switch between light and dark themes.

Theme Persistence: The selected theme is saved in local storage and persists even after page reload.

Responsive Design: Works seamlessly on mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.

Smooth Transitions: Provides smooth transitions between light and dark modes.

## Usage

Toggle Dark Mode: Click the toggle switch to switch between light and dark modes.

Persistent Theme: The app remembers your theme preference even after you refresh or revisit the page.

## Key Concepts


CSS Variables: Used to define color values for light and dark themes.

Local Storage: Stores the user’s theme preference (light or dark) so it persists across reloads.

React State: Manages the current theme state (light or dark).

Event Handling: Uses event listeners to handle theme toggling.

## Example
When you open the app:

The default theme (light or dark) will be applied based on the user’s previous choice.

Clicking the toggle switch will immediately change the theme, and the choice will be saved in the browser’s local storage.

## Dependencies

React: Frontend framework for building the UI.

CSS Modules or Styled Components: For styling the light and dark themes.
